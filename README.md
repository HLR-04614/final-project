# HR and BD's's final-project


This is a repository for Heather's final project for EcoEvoTheory Fall 2022.



## Project Proposal

Name(s) of the folks involved in this project: Heather and Beth

Working title: Applying ecological theories to predict metal sorption onto plastic debris

Project summary (1-2 sentences): We will reanalyze a 2015 metal dataset (published work:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31146064/) using code and theories we discussed in class to see if Neutral Theory can be applied to pollution data in the same way that it is used for species analysis.

Questions:

* Can neutral theory predict the demographics of metal adsorpted to different materials?

* Do materials with higher immigration such as glass show more evenness in metal demographics than lower immigration materials?

* What impact does site location have on the fit of the neutral theory models?

What is especially interesting (to you!) about this project?: Heather knows the data well and spent a lot of time looking at it. It would be really neat to see if this branch of ecology can be used to gain insight into environmental pollution behavior.

How do you plan to tackle this project?: We'll start by taking code from class and running the code using the 2015 metals data. We might have to look at subsets of the data first.

By Wednesday we will:

* Create a joint GoogleDocs folder to put sources and collaborative writing in

* Create a plan for division of labor

* Make an rmd file for code

* Spend a half hour each collecting literature about combining ecological theories with abiotic species, biofilm accumulation, and metal adsorption

What concepts or tools from class relate to this project?: Neutral theory and Lotka Voltera both relate to possible ways that metals could compete for sorption sites and are theories that might provide insight into how pollution amounts change over time on plastic debris.

What additional resources (code, data, literature) would support this project?:

How can Andy or Renata help?:
Question for Andy: how to model the biofilm accumulation?
